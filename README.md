# rustcc

A C compiler written in Rust, following [this tutorial](https://norasandler.com/2017/11/29/Write-a-Compiler.html).

I did this project as a way of learning both Rust and compiler design. Because I am a complete beginner at both
of those things, I'm sure there are lots of ways this program could be improved. Suggestions and constructive criticism
are welcome.
